# Hello worldüßöüèª‚ú®

As a data scientist, I am constantly immersed in the world of numbers, algorithms, and insights. Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy in the simple and vibrant aspects of life. Sports have a special place in my heart, providing an exhilarating escape from the analytical world of data. Music festivals are my sanctuary, where I lose myself in the electric energy of the crowd, surrounded by the rhythms that connect us all.

Switzerland, particularly Zurich, has become my temporary home, where I've had the privilege of engaging with a diverse community of professionals in the field of computer science. This enriching experience has broadened my horizons and exposed me to the cutting-edge developments in technology.

In the juxtaposition of my academic journey and my passion for life's simple pleasures, hiking around Switzerland has become a must on some weekends :)
